SINCE ACURRACY IS NOT A GOOD METRIC TO EVALUATE CLASSIFIERS
So,we have multiple metric to EVALUATE
1)Confusion matrix:-It is an matrix in which our rows are negative,positive actual and columns are predicted negavtive,positive.
e.g.we want to classify digit 2 and our test inouts are 1,3,4,5 i.e negative actual and 2 is positive actual.&
predicted -ve,+ve are classify by our classifier
y-target(actual)=[0 1 0 1 1 0]
y-predicted  =   [1 1 0 1 0 1]
Confusion matrix:-
           0predicted   1predicted
0actual   |    1           2      |
1actual   |    1           2      |
